# Welcome! 

These docs (credentials and criticisms) can hopefully shed some light on what I'm like to work with. At least the flavor, you know?

In this folder there's:
1. Feedback from the writers that I've been lucky enough to work with at Hume. These files start with "Hume_".
2. Students' course evaluations of my quarters as a teaching fellow for Psych One. Those files start with "TA_Elizabeth".
3. My CV, because it's nice to know I'm not just a rogue do-gooder, I'm a rogue do-gooder with some concrete skills.

Happy reading and if you have questions or comments (mortenson@stanford.edu) -- please share! I like that constructive feedback!
